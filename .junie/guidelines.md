# AGENTS.md — LLM & Developer Guidelines v2.4 (Git-Enabled Release)

## 🧱 0. Precedence & Scope

These rules define exactly how LLM agents and human developers collaborate in this repository.

## 🧠 Capabilities

Agents **ARE allowed** to:

- Execute shell commands  
- Interact with git (checkout, branch creation, committing, pushing)  
- Create and push feature branches  
- Create GitHub Pull Requests (via GitHub CLI or API)

Agents MUST:

- Log every meaningful shell and git operation into `request-log.md`  
- Operate only within the repository provided  
- Halt and request updated credentials if any authentication step fails  
- Report command results transparently

# 🧱 1. Immutable Laws

1. **Ask for clarification when needed. Proceed when not.**  
3. **All sprint planning and output artifacts live in `./planning`.**  
4. **Never use or depend on `./deprecated` in deliverables. You may read it for historical context, but MUST NOT import, execute, copy forward, or make deliverables depend on it.**  
5. **Artifacts in `./preview` are directional only, not implementation-ready.**  
6. **This document is executable intent.** Everything must be:  
   - Traceable  
   - Reproducible  
   - Reversible  

---

# 🌀 2. LLM Sprint Protocol

This protocol governs every LLM-led sprint.

```
Plan → Approve → Implement → Validate → Verify → Publish (PR) → Retro → Learn
```

It ensures reproducibility, reviewability, and continuous improvement.

## 🧭 2.1 Sprint Control Rules

| Rule | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **S1** | A sprint begins only when the user explicitly says **“Start sprint”**. |
| **S2** | A sprint ends when validation criteria are satisfied OR documented exceptions are explicitly accepted, and the user says **“Sprint complete.”** Alternatively, the user may say **“Force complete sprint.”** |
| **S3** | Only one sprint may be active at a time. |
| **S4** | Prompts related to this repo are included in sprint scope unless the user specifies otherwise. |
| **S5** | If sprint state is unclear, ask once, then proceed with best judgment, but do not bypass explicit approval gates (e.g., do not implement before the plan is approved). Pause until clarified. |

---

# 🚀 2.2 Sprint Start

When a sprint starts, the agent MUST:

1. **Generate a sprint ID**
   ```
   sprint-<number>-<short-hash>
   ```
2. **Create the sprint directory**
   ```
   planning/sprint-<id>/
   ```
3. **Create a new feature branch**
   ```
   git checkout -b feature/<sprint-id>-<short-description>
   ```
4. **Create `sprint-manifest.yaml`** with required metadata (see schema below)
5. **Log the action in `request-log.md`**

Example:
```
git checkout -b feature/sprint-7-a13b2f-user-profile-service
```

---

# 🧩 2.3 Sprint Directory Structure

```
planning/
  sprint-7-a13b2f/
    sprint-manifest.yaml
    implementation-plan.md
    backlog.yaml
    request-log.md
    validate_deliverable.sh
    verification-report.md
    publication.yaml
    retro.md
    key-learnings.md
```

This directory is the single authoritative source of truth for every sprint.

---

## Sprint Manifest Schema

Each sprint directory MUST contain a `sprint-manifest.yaml` with the following fields:

```yaml
id: sprint-<number>-<short-hash>
title: "Concise sprint title"
goal: "Clear sprint objective"
owner: "@github-handle or name"
createdAt: "YYYY-MM-DDTHH:mm:ssZ"
status: "planning | in-progress | validating | verifying | published | complete"
links:
  pr: "https://github.com/<org>/<repo>/pull/<number>" # optional until created
  branch: "feature/<sprint-id>-<short-description>"
notes: |
  Key assumptions, constraints, and context.
```

---

# 📝 2.4 Planning Phase — *Coding Forbidden Until Approved*

Before ANY implementation begins:

- The agent generates `implementation-plan.md` and `backlog.yaml`
- The user must explicitly approve it

### Required contents:

```markdown
# Implementation Plan – sprint-X-Y

## Objective
- Clear user-approved sprint goal.

## Scope
- What is in scope
- What is out of scope

## Deliverables
- Code changes
- Tests
- Deployment & CI artifacts
- Documentation

## Acceptance Criteria
- Verifiable, observable behavioral outcomes

## Testing Strategy
- Unit test and integration test approach

## Deployment Approach
- Cloud Build, Cloud Run, or other targets

## Dependencies
- External systems, credentials, services

## Definition of Done
- MUST reference project-wide DoD unless explicitly overridden
```

---

# ⚙️ 2.5 Execution Phase

Every user prompt relevant to the sprint MUST be logged in `request-log.md`:

- Timestamp  
- Prompt summary  
- Interpretation  
- Shell/git commands executed  
- Files modified or created  

Optional:  
`code-summary.md` mapping files → request IDs.

---

# 🧪 2.6 Validation Phase — *Mandatory Real Build + Test*

Every sprint MUST include a **real, executable** `validate_deliverable.sh` script.

This script MUST:

1. Install dependencies  
2. Build the project  
3. Run the test suite  
4. Start local runtime (if applicable)  
5. Perform health checks (manual or scripted)  
6. Shut down local runtime  
7. Run Cloud Build/Cloud Run dry-run deployment (if defined)

Use stack-appropriate commands for your service. The example below is for Node/TypeScript projects; for other stacks, use equivalent commands (e.g., Python: pip/poetry, pytest; Go: go build, go test).

### Required script shape (Node/TypeScript example):

```bash
#!/usr/bin/env bash
set -euo pipefail

echo "🔧 Installing dependencies..."
npm ci

echo "🧱 Building project..."
npm run build   # MUST succeed

echo "🧪 Running tests..."
npm test        # MUST pass

echo "🏃 Starting local environment..."
npm run local || true

echo "📝 Healthcheck..."
# Script/test/endpoint-based check recommended

echo "🧹 Stopping local environment..."
npm run local:down || true

echo "🚀 Cloud dry-run deployment..."
npm run deploy:cloud -- --dry-run || true

echo "✅ Validation complete."
```

### Critical rule:
> **A sprint should not be considered ready to close unless `validate_deliverable.sh` is **logically passable** (i.e., all referenced commands exist and are intended to succeed) and aligned with the project-wide DoD. If the script cannot currently succeed due to environment issues (missing tools, credentials, or external systems), the agent must log the failure, include it in `verification-report.md`, and may still proceed to closure if the user explicitly accepts the current state.**

---

# 🔍 2.7 Verification Phase

`verification-report.md` must summarize:

- Completed items  
- Partial implementations  
- Deferred items  
- Deviations from the implementation plan  

Example:

```markdown
# Deliverable Verification – sprint-X-Y

## Completed
- [x] Twitch event handler implemented
- [x] Tests created
- [x] Cloud Build config added

## Partial
- [ ] Observability integration (stubbed)

## Deferred
- [ ] Multi-region deployment

## Alignment Notes
- Added health endpoint not originally specified
```

---

# 🔀 2.8 Publication Phase — *Real GitHub PR Required*

At the end of implementation and verification:

### The agent MUST:

1. Add all changed files  
2. Commit using a sprint-specific message  
3. Push the feature branch to GitHub  
4. Create a real Pull Request using GitHub CLI or API.

GitHub CLI example:
```
gh pr create \
  --title "Sprint <id> Deliverables – <summary>" \
  --body "Generated by LLM agent according to Sprint Protocol v2.4."
```

GitHub API example (requires token):
```
curl -X POST \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <GITHUB_TOKEN>" \
  -H "Accept: application/vnd.github+json" \
  https://api.github.com/repos/<owner>/<repo>/pulls \
  -d '{
    "title": "Sprint <id> Deliverables – <summary>",
    "head": "feature/<sprint-id>-<short-description>",
    "base": "main",
    "body": "Generated by LLM agent according to Sprint Protocol v2.4."
  }'
```

If your chosen method fails (CLI or API):

- Stop immediately  
- Log the failure  
- Ask for updated credentials or API token  

### Publication Rules

| Rule | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **S11** | A new feature branch MUST be created at sprint start and used for all sprint changes. |
| **S12** | At sprint completion, the agent MUST attempt to create a GitHub Pull Request for the feature branch and log the result (success or failure). |
| **S13** | A sprint cannot close until either (a) a PR has been successfully created and its URL recorded in `publication.yaml`, **or** (b) a failed PR attempt has been logged with the error reason and the user has explicitly accepted closure. |
`publication.yaml` should contain:

```yaml
pr_url: https://github.com/...
branch: feature/sprint-X-Y-...
status: created
```

---

# 🏁 2.9 Sprint Completion

A sprint officially completes when:

- `validate_deliverable.sh` is logically passable OR its current failures are documented and explicitly accepted by the user
- A PR has been successfully created and its URL recorded in `publication.yaml`, OR a failed PR attempt has been logged and the user has explicitly accepted closure
- `verification-report.md` and `retro.md` exist
- The user says: `Sprint complete.` or `Force complete sprint`

Then the agent generates:

- `retro.md` — what worked, what didn’t  
- `key-learnings.md` — lessons for future sprints  
---
### 2.10 Force Completion Override

If the user says `Force complete sprint`, the agent may close the sprint even if:

- `validate_deliverable.sh` would currently fail, or
- Tests are incomplete or failing, or
- The PR could not be created

…as long as:

1. All known failures and gaps are documented under **Partial** or **Deferred** in `verification-report.md`, and
2. The issues are briefly summarized in `retro.md` for future sprints to pick up.
---

# 🧮 3. Project-Wide Definition of Done (DoD)

A deliverable is “Done” only if:

### ✅ Code Quality
- No TODOs or placeholder logic in production paths
- Stubs are allowed only in non-production paths or behind feature flags

### ✅ Testing
- Tests for all new behavior (use Jest for Node/TypeScript services; use stack-appropriate frameworks for other stacks)  
- Mocks for external dependencies  
- `npm test` must pass  
- Test deferral requires explicit user approval

### ✅ Deployment Artifacts
If applicable:
- Dockerfile  
- Cloud Build YAML  
- Cloud Run configs  
- IaC  
These must integrate with `validate_deliverable.sh`

### ✅ Documentation
- Rationale, trade-offs, and notes  
- LLM hints (`llm_prompt`) where beneficial

### ✅ Traceability
All code changes trace back to:
- A sprint  
- A request ID in `request-log.md`

The user may explicitly accept missing or failing tests for this sprint; in that case, the gaps MUST be listed under **Deferred** in `verification-report.md` and noted in `retro.md`.

# ☁️ 4. GCP Integration Rules

- Cloud Run is default runtime  
- Cloud Build governs all builds and deployments  
- Artifact Registry stores all images  
- IaC lives under `infrastructure/`  
- Deployment configs should be reusable templates  

---

# 🧪 5. Testing Standards

- Tests required  
- For Node/TypeScript services, use Jest; for other stacks, use language-appropriate frameworks (e.g., pytest, go test)  
- Tests live beside code or in `__tests__/`  
- High coverage encouraged  
- External services mocked  
- Tests must run as part of validation  

---

# 📦 6. Deliverable Types

Every sprint must produce at least one:

- Code artifact  
- Tests  
- Deployment scripts  
- Architecture documentation  

And all outputs must:

- Build  
- Test  
- Integrate with the validation pipeline  

Note: Planning/Discovery sprints may produce documentation-only deliverables; validation should then lint, link-check, and verify structure instead of building code.

---

# 🧱 7. Project Structure

```
deprecated/      # Historical reference only
examples/        # Useful templates
planning/        # Sprint artifacts (authoritative)
preview/         # Visionary, non-binding artifacts
infrastructure/  # IaC, Cloud Build, Terraform files
src/             # Application code
```

---

# 🎯 8. Code Style Rules

- Application/services code is in TypeScript by default. If a service explicitly specifies a different stack, follow that stack. Scripts and infrastructure files remain in their native formats.  
- kebab-case filenames  
- PascalCase classes and interfaces  
- camelCase functions and variables  
- UPPER_SNAKE_CASE constants  

Logging:

- Always log through a logging facade if possible
- `info` for useful info  
- `error` for errors  
- `debug` for deep insight  
- Log all network + filesystem operations with context  

---

# 🧯 9. Error Handling & Events

- Strong try/catch discipline  
- Graceful shutdown of services  
- Validate environment variables  
- Use Pub/Sub for service communication  
- Normalize external events to internal schema  

---

# 👥 10. Collaboration Roles

- **Cloud Architect**  
- **Lead Architect**  
- **Lead Implementor**  
- **Quality Lead**  

(These describe responsibility domains—not rigid titles.)

---

# 🧠 11. Sprint Lifecycle Summary

```
Plan → Approve → Implement → Validate → Verify → Publish (PR) → Retro → Learn
```

The system is designed for:

- High traceability  
- Rigor  
- Iterative improvement  
- Human oversight
